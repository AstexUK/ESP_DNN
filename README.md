# Graph-convolutional DNN for predicting ESP surfaces

This repository contains the code to generate [PQR files] (https://apbs-pdb2pqr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/pqr.html)
for ligands and proteins that can be used to generate high quality ESP surfaces.
The PQR files records partial charge and radii in the PDB occupancy and b-factor
columns. PQR files generated by our models conatains charges on atoms as well as
off-centered charges on atomic features (e.g., lone pairs, sigma holes, p
orbitals).
For generating ligand PQR files, a graph convolutional deep neural network (DNN)
model, trained on ESP surfaces derived using high quality QM calculations, is 
used. For proteins, parametized charges for all amino acids are used, which are
fully compatible with the ligand ESP surfaces generated using the DNN model.
